            Hey Y'all. <br>I am a curious individual that is intrigued with technology. I like to tinker with the hardware as well as the software. My very first computer was when I was a kid. It was a desktop with a big monitor with Windows XP in it. It was just to play old racing games and this trend of playing games continued on with a much newer desktop when I was a teenager. <br> 
            
            <br>My first laptop was when I completed a tutoring program as a merit. Then at the start of high school, the school loaned laptops to be used for the advance courses. The journey to technology began with the purchase of the same laptop that was used in high school from a local surplus school in my hometown, Laredo, Texas. With the purchased laptop, it was used during college and during that time, I tinkered with the computers that I had to improve to be used for college during my vacation time.  The major that I went for was Systems Engineer at Texas A&M International University. <br>
            
            <br>After college, I took a good long break and then looked for jobs to start my career as an engineer in systems. In that search, I found a company that trains and deploys software engineers. My natural curiosity took over and I submitted an application to Revature. There I took multiple pre-selection questioners including a one-month course to be selected for an interview which I did get to the interview but was not selected despite of my exemplary work and progress from the course. Afterwards, the curiosity of the software only grew and brings me to the present time. <br>
